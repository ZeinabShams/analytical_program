# *Description*
*In this program, sales data is collected, loaded, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Python   libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy**, **scipy**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**.*
# *Usage*
*To use the program, you can first make sure you have the necessary libraries installed and download the 'sales_data.csv' file to the same directory as the program file. Then you can run the program in a Python environment or IDE.*
# *How It Workes*
*The program performes the following steps:*
1. *Collect the sales data from the 'sales_data.csv' file using the **pandas** library.*
2. *Load and display the collected data using the the **pandas** library.*
3. *Clean the data by removing any missing values using the **pandas** library.*
4. *Analyze the sales data by calculating the total sales by product and by month, calculating the mean and standard deviation of sales by product, and performing a ttest to compare the mean sales of two products using the **pandas** and **scipy** libraries.*
5. *Visualize the sales data by creating **bar**, **line**, and **violin** polts using the **seaborn** and **matplotlib** libraries.*
6. *Display the first 10 rowa of cleaned data using the pandas library.*
7. *Save the cleaned data to a CSV file using the pandas library.*
# *Requirements*
*This program requires the installation of the following libraries:*
- **pandas**
~~~
pip install pandas
~~~
- **numpy**
~~~
pip install numpy
~~~
- **scipy**
~~~
pip install scipy
~~~
- **seaborn**
~~~
pip install seaborn
~~~
- **matplotlib**
~~~
pip install matplotlib
~~~
*It also requires the 'sales_data.csv' file to be present in the same directory as the program file.*
# *Future Improvements*
*This program can be improved by adding more advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, such as regression analysis, clustering, and geographic mapping. It can also be made more interactive by creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library such as PyQt or Tkinter.*
